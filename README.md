# Description 
Simple Login/Registration form created in Python which lets me store user credentials in a .txt file and login using them afterwards. Not safe or secure at all but i wasn't going for that.

# What i learned
-Work with the tkinter module to create the GUI and insert data into the .txt file.

-Work with the csv module to extract the information from the .txt file.

-Work with the pillow module to insert an image onto the GUI.
